- A non-interrupt based USB keyboard library for Arduino, heavilly inspired by [Evan Kale's work](https://github.com/evankale/ArduinoBTPS2).

- The main sketch is used for the Arduino Bluetooth Keyboard Adapter.
- You need to install USBHost from [this fork](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/USBHost), not vanilla one
